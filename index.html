<h2><u>Scramble Coding Help</u></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Steps:</h3>
		<ol>
			<h3><li>ARRAYS</h3>
					Create new arrays that contain the scramble notation.
					<br>
					Use, "$:", to define a new array.
					<br>
					Separate each scramble notation with ",".
					<h5>EX:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>$:F,B,R,L,U,D</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<h3><li>VARIABLES</h3>
					Create new variables that are based on the arrays.
					<br>
					Use, "@c", to define a new array, and "c" being any alphabetical character
					<ul>
						<li><h6>It can be any symbol but using wildcards can confuse the program</h6></li>
					</ul>
					In "{}" brackets, define which array to pull notation from. (First array starts at 0)
					<br>
					In "[]" brackets, define which specific notations are going to be pulled. (First notation starts at 0)
					<ul>
						<li>Separate each new entry with a ","</li>
						<li>Use, "e", to pull every notation from an array</li>
					</ul>
					In "()" brackets, define its scramble type
					<table border="1px">
						<tr>
							<td>l
							<td>list every notation item
						<tr>
							<td>n#
							<td>Randomly choose a notation item, repeated for #, but same notation won't repeat after each other
						<tr>
							<td>o
							<td>Randomly list every notation item, but same notation won't repeat after each other
						<tr>
							<td>r#1-#1
							<td>Randomly choose a notation item, repeated for any number between #1(min) and #2(max), items won't be repeated
						<tr>
							<td>s#1-#2
							<td>Randomly choose a notation item, repeated for any number between #1(min) and #2(max), but same notation won't repeat after each other
					</table>
					<ul>
						<li><h6>Same Notation: first letter of a notation item won't repeat</h6></li>
					</ul>
					<h5>EX:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>
							@a{0}[0,1,3](u10)
							<ul>
								<li>Variable "a", now pulls from array 0 (Array 0 was set to F,B,R,L,U,D), takes items number 0, 1, and 3 (F,B, and L), and randomly chooses one item 10 times</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<h3><li>PATTERNS</h3>
					Use, "%:", to create a new pattern.
					<br>
					Call variables in any order.
					<h5>EX:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>If we had created a variable called, "a", "b", and "c" and we made the pattern "abca", it would call the variable a, then b, then c, then a again.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
		<h3><li>EXAMBLE CODE FOR PYRAMINX</h3>
				<b>INPUT</b>
				<div style="background-color: #cccccc; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; width: 50%;">
					$:B,R,L,U,B',R',L',U'
					<br>
					$:b,r,l,u,b',r',l',u'
					<br>
					<br>
					@a{0}[e](n11)
					<br>
					@t{1}[e](s0-4)
					<br>
					<br>
					%at
				</div>
				<b>OUTPUT</b>
				<div style="background-color: #cccccc; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; width: 50%;">
					<i>*not seen*
					<br>
					Variable a = B,R,L,U,B',R',L',U'. randomize 11 times
					<br>
					Variable t = b,r,l,u,b',r',l',u'. random number between 0 and 4
					<br>
					<br>
					a = B' L B U' R L' B' U L R' U
					<br>
					<br>
					random number is set to 2
					<br>
					t = l' u'
					<br>
					<br>
					a + t</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					*what is seen*
					<br>
					<b>B' L B U' R L' B' U L R' U l' u'</b>
				</div>
			</li>
	</li>
		<h3><li>NOTES</h3>
				Each piece of code needs its own line
				<br>
				Space are not recognized, so items ca be serated with spaces
				<br>
				Multiple patterns can be created, and are activated in order
				<br>
				Text is ignored, so you can freely write comments and text on new lines
			</li>
</ul>
